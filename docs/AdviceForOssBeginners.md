# Advice for OSS Beginners

//TODO: flesh out these points


## Pay attention to instructions

Take your time to learn and follow the workflow to the letter. 
Do not skip any steps because you think that step is "not important". 

## Stick to given versions

## Follow others

## Do your homework

Use Google, read trouble shooting guides, search issue tracker (including closed issues)

## Quality > Speed

Fixing an issue quickly is not the most important thing. In fact, issues given to new contributors are the ones 
the dev team already know how to fix. The dev team is more interested to see how you go about fixing the issue. 
They want to know whether you are systematic and detail-oriented.
 
The project developers are more impressed when you finish an issue in fewer attempts than when you finish it 
in a shorter time but take many attempts because you were not meticulous enough along the way.
